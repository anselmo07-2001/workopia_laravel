# Workopia
Workopia Laravel is a simple job platform I built using Laravel, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.

### Features:
- Users can sign up, apply to jobs, and bookmark them
- Search jobs and view details like salary, tags, requirements, contract type (full-time, part-time, contract), and whether it's remote
- View company locations using Mapbox
- Create your own job post
- If someone applies to your job, you'll get an email (via Mailtrap) with their info and resume
- You can also view applicants from your dashboard — see their name and download their resume
- Users can update their profile info and profile picture

- I’ve also created this before using **vanilla PHP**. You can check it out here: https://github.com/anselmo07-2001/workopia-v2
